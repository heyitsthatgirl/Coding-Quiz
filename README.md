# Coding-Quiz

My Coding Quiz app is a fun example of how JavaScript can be used to create an interactive application! <br/>

From the homepage a user can choose to view the existing high scores saved on their device, or start the Coding Quiz Challenge by clicking on the 'Start Quiz' button. <br/>

Once the quiz has begun, the user will race against the clock to answer a series of JavaScript-related questions. After clicking on an answer to a question, the user will be notified as to whether or not the answer they chose was the 'Right Answer!' If the 'Wrong Answer!' was selected, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the remaining time available. <br/>

If time runs out before the quiz is completed, the user will be presented with the opportunity to 'Try Again?' and can return to the homepage.<br/>

Once the user has answered all of the questions, they will be presented with their score, and can save their initials. The user will then be directed to the High Scores page, where their initials and score will be displayed along with previously existing scores. From there the user can choose to return to the homepage, or clear all existing scores.<br/>
